They found Vivienne in\r\nrespiratory failure. Vivienne was rushed to the hospital. When they arrived, a\r\ngroup of emergency room staff, including Vivienne's obstetrician, were unable\r\nto resuscitate Vivienne and pronounced her dead at 2100.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">  </span>Vivienne's obstetrician accessed her EHR\r\nwhich was populated with Vivienne's basic identifying information including her\r\nname, birth date, sex, address, zip code, and social security number.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">  </span>Vivienne had been treated for preeclampsia\r\nduring her pregnancy and this seemed the most likely cause of death; however\r\nher doctor indicated that he wanted an autopsy to be performed and added a\r\nreferral note. The pathologist/medical examiner, performed an autopsy on\r\nJanuary 23</span><sup><span style=\"font-family:\">rd</span></sup><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\r\n\">. He noted in the EHR\r\nthat Vivienne was pregnant at the time of her death. He noted pulmonary edema\r\nand other blood protein and urine results that pointed to eclampsia as the\r\nunderlying cause of death, although he listed \"Cardiopulmonary arrest\" as the\r\nimmediate cause and entered the duration. <br>\r\nHe listed \"Eclampsia\" as the underlying cause of death with a separate\r\nduration.  He entered his\r\nidentifying information as the death certifier, signed the death certificate\r\nand indicated that the autopsy results were available. At that point, all\r\ninformation related to filing the death certificate is transmitted via an </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\">ADT^A04 message<span style=\"color:black;mso-themecolor:text1\"> from the EHR to the jurisdictional\r\nvital records office.</span></span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"></span></font></p><font size=\"1\">\r\n\r\n</font>",
